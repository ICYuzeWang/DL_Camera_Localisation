This repository includes the PoseNet framework used to build the pose estimation models (where the work on Loss functions and new model architectures are stored), the MATLAB code used to analyse the data and plot the majority of the results.

The data can be generated by toolkits in Unity. The work in creating new model architecture is mainly in models/posenet.py, and loss functions in common/criterion.py.

PlotResults.m x is used to generate results.
